# 3. Link Equation

## Definition

The **link equation** (also called the **link budget equation**) is a fundamental tool in satellite communications that relates the received power to the transmitter power, antenna gains, and propagation losses. It provides a comprehensive assessment of whether a communication link can function reliably.

## Basic Link Equation

$$P_r = P_t + G_t - L_{path} + G_r$$

Where:
- $P_r$ = Received power (dBm or dBW)
- $P_t$ = Transmitted power (dBm or dBW)
- $G_t$ = Transmitter antenna gain (dBi)
- $L_{path}$ = Total path loss (dB)
- $G_r$ = Receiver antenna gain (dBi)

All quantities are expressed in decibels (dB) for easier calculation.

## Extended Link Equation (Link Budget)

A more detailed version includes all relevant gains and losses:

$$P_r = \text{EIRP} - L_{fs} - L_{atm} - L_{rain} + G_r$$

Or equivalently:

$$P_r = P_t + G_t - L_{fs} - L_{atm} - L_{rain} + G_r$$

Where:
- $\text{EIRP} = P_t + G_t$ = Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power
- $L_{fs}$ = Free space path loss
- $L_{atm}$ = Atmospheric losses
- $L_{rain}$ = Rain losses (worst-case or statistical)
- $G_r$ = Receiver antenna gain

## Link Budget Table Format

A typical link budget is organized as:

| Parameter | Value (dB/dBm/dBW) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Transmit Side** | | |
| Transmitter Power | +30 dBW (1 kW) | |
| Transmitter Antenna Gain | +42 dBi | Large parabolic antenna |
| **EIRP** | **+72 dBW** | **Sum of above** |
| | | |
| **Propagation** | | |
| Free Space Path Loss | -210 dB | 12 GHz, 40,000 km |
| Atmospheric Loss | -1 dB | Clear sky |
| Rain Loss | -3 dB | 99% availability |
| **Total Loss** | **-214 dB** | |
| | | |
| **Receive Side** | | |
| Receiver Antenna Gain | +45 dBi | 3.7 m dish at 12 GHz |
| Receiver Power | **-97 dBW** | EIRP - Losses + Gain |
| | | |
| **Performance** | | |
| Noise Figure | +3 dB | System noise figure |
| Required C/N | +10 dB | For desired BER |
| **Link Margin** | **+14 dB** | **Spare capacity** |

## Key Concepts

### 1. Received Power Calculation

The received power is determined by the entire path from transmitter to receiver. A strong EIRP helps, but receiver antenna gain is equally important for capturing that power.

### 2. Link Margin

$$L_m = P_r - P_{min}$$

Where:
- $L_m$ = Link margin
- $P_r$ = Actual received power
- $P_{min}$ = Minimum required power (C/N + noise figure)

**Positive margin** = link works
**Negative margin** = link fails
**Typical target**: 3-10 dB margin for reliability

### 3. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)

$$C/N = P_r - N_0 B - F$$

Where:
- $P_r$ = Received power
- $N_0$ = Noise power spectral density (-174 dBm/Hz at room temperature)
- $B$ = Bandwidth
- $F$ = Noise figure

## Uplink and Downlink

Satellite systems typically require **two separate link budgets**:

### Uplink (Earth to Satellite)
- From ground station to satellite
- Limited by satellite receiving capabilities and interference limits
- Often more demanding than downlink

### Downlink (Satellite to Earth)
- From satellite to ground station
- Limited by satellite transmitted power
- More feasible to achieve good performance

Both links must have adequate margins for the overall system to function.

## Practical Example: Ku-band GEO Satellite Link

**Assumptions**:
- Frequency: 12 GHz (Downlink)
- Distance: 40,000 km (GEO satellite)
- Clear sky conditions
- Required BER: $10^{-6}$ (C/N = 10 dB)

**Calculation**:

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Satellite TX power | +35 dBW |
| Satellite antenna gain | +42 dBi |
| EIRP | +77 dBW |
| Free space loss (40,000 km, 12 GHz) | -210 dB |
| Atmospheric loss | -1 dB |
| Rain loss (99% availability) | -3 dB |
| Receiving antenna gain (3.7 m dish) | +45 dBi |
| **Received power** | **-92 dBW** |
| | |
| Noise temperature | 290 K (F ≈ 3 dB) |
| Bandwidth | 36 MHz |
| Noise floor | -175 dBW + 75.5 dB = -99.5 dBW |
| **C/N ratio** | **+7.5 dB** |
| Required C/N | +10 dB |
| **Link margin** | **-2.5 dB** (MARGINAL) |

*In this case, either more transmit power, larger receiving antenna, or better weather conditions would be needed.*

## Link Margin Interpretation

| Margin | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| > +10 dB | Excellent; large safety factor |
| +5 to +10 dB | Good; adequate for most applications |
| 0 to +5 dB | Acceptable; minimal safety margin |
| < 0 dB | **Link fails**; not viable |
| -3 to 0 dB | On the edge; unreliable |

## Important Considerations

1. **Rain Statistics**: Use location-specific rain attenuation data (e.g., ITU-R P.618 or local measurements)

2. **Fading**: Mobile and atmospheric conditions cause fading; margin accounts for worst-case scenarios

3. **Modulation & Coding**: Higher-order modulation requires higher C/N but uses bandwidth more efficiently

4. **Frequency Selection**: Lower frequencies have lower path loss but less antenna gain for same dish size

5. **Time Variability**: Clear sky conditions vary with time; link margin ensures reliability percentage target
