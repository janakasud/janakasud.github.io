# 10. G/T

## Definition

**Gain over Noise Temperature (G/T)** is a figure of merit for receiving antenna systems that combines antenna gain with receiver noise figure. It represents how well a receiving system can capture weak signals while minimizing internally generated noise. Higher G/T indicates better receiver performance.

**Units**:
- dB/K (decibels per Kelvin)
- Linear: dimensionless ratio

**Symbol**: G/T (antenna gain over system noise temperature)

---

## Formula

$$\frac{G}{T} = \frac{G_r}{T_s}$$

Where:
- $G_r$ = Receiving antenna gain (linear ratio)
- $T_s$ = System noise temperature (in Kelvin)

In decibels:
$$\frac{G}{T} \text{ (dB/K)} = G_r \text{ (dBi)} - 10\log_{10}(T_s)$$

**Example**: Antenna gain = 45 dBi, System noise temperature = 110 K
$$\frac{G}{T} = 45 - 10\log_{10}(110) = 45 - 20.41 = 24.59 \text{ dB/K}$$

## System Noise Temperature

System noise temperature is NOT the physical temperature of components. It represents the equivalent temperature of a perfect (noiseless) system that would produce the same noise output.

### Cascade Noise Temperature

For a cascaded system (antenna → LNA → receiver):

$$T_s = T_{ant} + \frac{T_{LNA}}{G_{LNA}} + \frac{T_{rx}}{G_{LNA} \cdot G_{LNA2}} + ...$$

Where:
- $T_{ant}$ = Antenna physical temperature (typically 290 K for Earth-pointing antennas)
- $T_{LNA}$ = LNA noise temperature
- $G_{LNA}$ = LNA gain

**Key Insight**: The **first amplification stage dominates** the system noise. A low-noise amplifier (LNA) immediately after the antenna is essential.

### Typical System Noise Temperatures

| System Configuration | T_s (K) | G/T at 45 dBi |
|---|---|---|
| Poor (no LNA) | 400-500 K | 12-15 dB/K |
| Standard | 150-200 K | 21-22 dB/K |
| Good | 75-100 K | 23-24 dB/K |
| Excellent | 30-50 K | 25-27 dB/K |
| Premium (cooled) | 10-20 K | 27-29 dB/K |

## Relationship to Noise Figure

System noise temperature is related to noise figure:

$$T_s = T_{ref}(F - 1)$$

Where:
- $T_{ref}$ = Reference temperature (290 K standard)
- $F$ = Noise figure (linear)

In dB:
$$T_s = 290 \times 10^{(NF-0)/10} - 290$$

**Example**: Noise figure = 1.5 dB
$$NF_{linear} = 10^{1.5/10} = 1.413$$
$$T_s = 290 \times (1.413 - 1) = 119.8 \text{ K}$$

## Practical Impact on C/N

G/T directly affects the achievable carrier-to-noise ratio:

$$C/N_o = \text{EIRP} - L_{path} + \frac{G}{T} + k_B + B$$

Where:
- $k_B$ = Boltzmann constant (-228.6 dBJ/K)

A **1 dB improvement in G/T** yields a **1 dB improvement in C/N**, directly translating to:
- Better performance margin
- Higher achievable data rates
- Operation in worse weather conditions
- Reduced transmit power requirements

## Improving G/T: Practical Strategies

### 1. Increase Antenna Gain

$$G_r \propto \left(\frac{\pi D}{\lambda}\right)^2$$

Where D is antenna diameter and λ is wavelength.

- **Double antenna diameter** → +6 dB gain (larger dish)
- **Higher frequency** → Higher gain for same dish size
- **Cost**: Larger antennas are expensive and require precise pointing

**Effect on G/T**: Directly increases G/T (linear addition in dB)

### 2. Reduce System Noise Temperature

**Methods**:
- Use a **high-quality LNA**: Typically 0.5-2 dB noise figure
- **Cryogenic cooling**: Cool LNA to 77 K (liquid nitrogen) or below
- Minimize **feeder cable losses**: Use low-loss coaxial cable or waveguide
- **Optimize component selection**: Premium LNAs vs. standard components

**Practical Reduction**:
- Standard LNA: ~70 K reduction from antenna temperature
- Quality LNA: ~100-150 K reduction  
- Cryogenic LNA: ~250+ K reduction (T_s < 50 K possible)

**Effect on G/T**: Each ~10 K reduction in T_s improves G/T by ~0.4 dB

### 3. Combined Approach

Optimal design balances:
- Reasonable antenna size (cost vs. gain)
- High-quality LNA (noise figure vs. cost)
- Careful component selection and integration

**Example**: Satellite Earth Station Upgrades
- Upgrade 2.4 m dish → 3.7 m dish: +3.7 dB (from gain)
- Replace LNA + reduce cable loss: +2 dB (from noise temperature)
- **Total G/T improvement**: ~5.7 dB

## G/T Comparison: Receiver Types

| Receiver Type | Typical G/T | Application |
|---|---|---|
| **Mobile terminal** | 0-5 dB/K | Handheld satellite phones |
| **Small terminal** | 10-15 dB/K | VSAT, maritime |
| **Medium Earth station** | 20-23 dB/K | Standard commercial |
| **Large Earth station** | 23-27 dB/K | Teleport, hub |
| **High-performance** | 27-30 dB/K | Deep-space, military |

## Example: Ku-band Earth Station Design

**Requirements**: Achieve C/No ≥ 80 dB-Hz for 10 Mbps service with QPSK

**Satellite EIRP**: 70 dBW
**Path loss**: -210 dB (40,000 km, 12 GHz)
**Atmospheric loss**: -1 dB

**Available Power** at Earth station antenna:
$$P_{available} = 70 - 210 - 1 = -141 \text{ dBW}$$

**Required C/No**: 80 dB-Hz

**Noise Spectral Density** (N₀):
$$N_o = P_{available} - \frac{G}{T} - k_B$$
$$N_o = -141 - \frac{G}{T} - (-228.6)$$

Setting N_o such that C/No = 80:
$$-141 - \frac{G}{T} - (-228.6) = -80$$
$$\frac{G}{T} = -141 + 228.6 + 80 = 167.6 \text{ (linear)} = 22.2 \text{ dB/K}$$

**Design Options**:

**Option A: Standard 2.4 m antenna**
- Gain at 12 GHz: ~43 dBi
- Need: T_s = 43 - 22.2 = 20.8 dB = 120 K
- Feasible with standard LNA (NF ≈ 1.5 dB)

**Option B: Premium 1.2 m antenna**
- Gain at 12 GHz: ~37 dBi  
- Need: T_s = 37 - 22.2 = 14.8 dB ≈ 30 K
- Requires cryogenic cooling (expensive)

**Optimal Choice**: Standard 2.4 m antenna + good LNA is cost-effective for this requirement.

## Key Tradeoffs in System Design

| Design Goal | Action | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| **Maximize G/T** | Large antenna + cryogenic LNA | High cost, complex |

| **Balance** | Medium antenna + quality LNA | Reasonable cost/performance |
| **Mobile** | Small antenna + premium LNA | High per-unit cost |

## Measurement and Verification

G/T can be measured or computed:

**Measurement**: 
- Observe signal from known satellite (constant EIRP)
- Measure received power and noise floor
- Calculate G/T from known path loss and satellite parameters

**Computation**:
- Measure antenna gain (antenna range test)
- Measure system noise temperature (noise figure meter)
- Calculate G/T from formula

**Importance**: Verify actual G/T matches design specifications; environmental factors (wind, temperature) can affect both gain and noise temperature.
