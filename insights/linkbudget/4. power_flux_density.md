# 4. Power Flux Density

## Definition

**Power Flux Density (PFD)** is the amount of electromagnetic power per unit area at a specific location. It represents the intensity of the radio signal at a given point in space and is a critical parameter for interference analysis and coverage planning in satellite communications.

**Units**: 
- Watts per square meter (W/m²) - linear
- dBW/m² or dBm/m² - logarithmic

---

## Relationship to EIRP

Power flux density is directly related to the **EIRP** of a transmitting antenna and the distance from the antenna:

$$\text{PFD} = \frac{\text{EIRP}}{4\pi d^2}$$

Where:
- $\text{EIRP}$ = Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (linear, in watts)
- $d$ = distance from antenna (in meters)

In decibels:
$$\text{PFD (dBW/m²)} = \text{EIRP (dBW)} - 20\log_{10}(d \text{ in meters}) - 10\log_{10}(4\pi)$$

$$\text{PFD (dBW/m²)} = \text{EIRP (dBW)} - 20\log_{10}(d) - 121.17$$

Or using distance in kilometers:
$$\text{PFD (dBW/m²)} = \text{EIRP (dBW)} - 20\log_{10}(d \text{ in km}) - 79.17$$

---

## Physical Interpretation

PFD represents how "dense" the electromagnetic energy is at a receiving point. 

**Analogy**: If EIRP is total power radiated by a lightbulb, PFD is the brightness (illumination) you observe at a distance.

**Key Insight**: PFD decreases with the **square of distance** (inverse square law):
- Double the distance → 1/4 the PFD (or -6 dB)
- 10× the distance → 1/100 the PFD (or -20 dB)

---

## Relationship to Received Power

Once PFD is known, the received power at an antenna can be calculated:

$$P_r = \text{PFD} \times A_e$$

Where:
- $A_e$ = Effective aperture of receiving antenna

$$A_e = \frac{\lambda^2 \times G_r}{4\pi}$$

Where:
- $\lambda$ = wavelength
- $G_r$ = receiver antenna gain

In decibels:
$$P_r \text{ (dBW)} = \text{PFD (dBW/m²)} + A_e \text{ (dBm²)}$$

---

## Typical PFD Values in Satellite Communications

### GEO Satellite Coverage

For a typical GEO satellite at 40,000 km with EIRP = 70 dBW:

$$\text{PFD} = 70 - 20\log_{10}(40,000,000) - 121.17 = -82 \text{ dBW/m²}$$

### Comparison of PFD at Different Distances

| Distance | Frequency | EIRP | PFD |
|----------|-----------|------|-----|
| 100 km | 10 GHz | +50 dBW | -72 dBW/m² |
| 1,000 km | 10 GHz | +50 dBW | -92 dBW/m² |
| 40,000 km | 10 GHz | +50 dBW | -142 dBW/m² |
| 40,000 km | 20 GHz | +50 dBW | -148 dBW/m² |

## Regulatory PFD Limits

Satellite operators must comply with **ITU and national regulations** that limit PFD to prevent interference with other systems. These limits depend on:

1. **Frequency band**
2. **Type of satellite service** (fixed satellite service, broadcasting, mobile)
3. **Receiving location** (satellite, terrestrial, Earth station)
4. **Elevation angle** (for non-GEO satellites)

### Example: ITU-R S.728 Limits (Downlink PFD at Earth's surface)

**Ku-band (11.7-12.2 GHz) Downlink to Fixed Satellite Service Receivers**:

| Reception Type | Maximum PFD |
|---|---|
| Rural areas | -118 dBW/m² |
| Urban areas | -113 dBW/m² |
| Dense urban | -108 dBW/m² |

Higher limits apply in more populated areas to account for antenna characteristics and practical deployment.

### Rationale for Limits

- **Interference Prevention**: Limits protect terrestrial systems (WiFi, cellular) from satellite interference
- **Co-frequency Operation**: Multiple satellites can operate on same frequency if PFD limits are observed
- **Victim Receiver Protection**: Protects sensitive receivers from overload

## PFD vs. Link Budget

While **link budget** focuses on a **specific receiver's ability** to receive a signal, **PFD limits** ensure **system-wide compatibility**.

| Aspect | Link Budget | PFD Limit |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Focus** | Individual link performance | Interference management |
| **Scope** | Transmitter ↔ Receiver pair | All systems in coverage area |
| **Purpose** | Verify link works | Prevent interference |
| **Regulation** | Optional (system-dependent) | Mandatory (ITU/FCC) |

---

## Practical Example: Calculating PFD

**Scenario**: Ka-band satellite transmitter
- EIRP: 80 dBW (100 kW effective isotropic)
- Distance to ground: 38,000 km

**Calculation**:
$$\text{PFD} = 80 - 20\log_{10}(38 \times 10^6) - 121.17$$
$$\text{PFD} = 80 - 151.6 - 121.17 = -192.77 \text{ dBW/m²}$$

Or in conventional units:
$$\text{PFD} = \frac{100 \text{ kW}}{4\pi (38 \times 10^6)^2} = 1.74 \times 10^{-11} \text{ W/m²}$$

---

## Directivity and PFD Variation

Real satellite antennas are not isotropic. They have:

- **Main lobe**: Higher PFD in coverage area
- **Side lobes**: Lower but significant PFD outside intended coverage
- **Antenna pattern**: Determines actual PFD distribution

**Consequence**: PFD varies across coverage footprint, even at same distance from satellite.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **PFD measures signal intensity** at a location; essential for interference analysis
2. **Inverse square law** dominates: PFD ∝ 1/distance²
3. **Regulatory limits** ensure coexistence of multiple satellite and terrestrial systems
4. **Link budget** and **PFD limits** are complementary concepts
5. **Antenna gain and directivity** significantly influence PFD distribution in practical systems
