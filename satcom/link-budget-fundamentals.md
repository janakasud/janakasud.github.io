# 1. Antenna Theory
## Isotropic antenna
An isotropic transmitting antenna radiates a spherical wave with a uniform power $p_o/4\pi$ 
in any direction $(\theta, \phi)$ of the surrounding space ($p_o$ being the power available at the input of the antenna).

## Directional antenna

A directional antenna will radiate a power $p(\theta, \phi)$ in the direction $\theta, \phi$.

## Antenna Gain

The definition of the gain of an antenna is:

$$g(\theta, \phi) = \frac{p(\theta, \phi)}{p_o / 4\pi}  \quad (1)$$

$p_o$ is also the total radiated power (in all directions) and it can therefore be expressed as:

$$p_o = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\pi} p(\theta, \phi) \sin \theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \quad (2)$$

The maximum of the gain function is:

$$g_{max} = \frac{p_{max}}{p_o / 4\pi} \quad (3)$$

The maximum gain, $g_{max}$, is often called simply the "antenna gain", $g$, and is usually expressed 
as follows in decibels, and more precisely, in decibels over the gain of an isotropic antenna (dBi):

$$G = 10 \log_{10} g \quad (\text{dBi})  \quad (4)$$
