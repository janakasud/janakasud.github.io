# 3. Losses

Losses in satellite communication links represent the attenuation of signal power as it travels from the transmitter to the receiver. Understanding and accounting for these losses is critical for link budget analysis.

## 3.1. Spreading Loss (Path Loss)

**Definition**: Spreading loss occurs due to the geometric spreading of electromagnetic waves as they propagate through free space.

**Formula**:
$$L_s = \frac{4\pi d}{\lambda}$$

Where:
- $d$ = distance from transmitter to receiver
- $\lambda$ = wavelength of the signal

In decibels:
$$L_s \text{ (dB)} = 20 \log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi d}{\lambda}\right) = 20 \log_{10}(f) + 20 \log_{10}(d) + 32.45$$

Where:
- $f$ = frequency in MHz
- $d$ = distance in km

**Key Points**:
- Independent of frequency initially, but depends on wavelength ratio to distance
- Proportional to the square of distance
- Fundamental to all radio propagation
- Also called **free space path loss**

## 3.2. Free Space Loss

**Definition**: Free space loss is the loss of signal strength in an idealized environment with no obstacles, reflections, or interference. It represents the baseline loss against which other losses are measured.

**Formula**:
$$L_{fs} \text{ (dB)} = 92.45 + 20 \log_{10}(f \text{ in GHz}) + 20 \log_{10}(d \text{ in km})$$

**Factors Affecting Free Space Loss**:
- **Frequency**: Higher frequencies experience greater loss (proportional to $f^2$)
- **Distance**: Loss increases with distance (proportional to $d^2$)
- **Antenna Aperture**: Larger antennas improve reception to partially offset path loss

**Comparison with Spreading Loss**:
- Spreading loss is the fundamental phenomenon
- Free space loss is the calculated path loss in ideal conditions
- Both terms are sometimes used interchangeably in link budgets

**Example**:
For a 12 GHz signal over 40,000 km (GEO satellite):
$$L_{fs} = 92.45 + 20 \log_{10}(12) + 20 \log_{10}(40,000)$$
$$L_{fs} = 92.45 + 21.58 + 92.04 = 206.07 \text{ dB}$$

## 3.3. Atmospheric Loss

**Definition**: Atmospheric loss (or atmospheric attenuation) is caused by absorption and scattering of radio waves by gases and particles in the atmosphere.

**Main Contributors**:
- **Oxygen (O₂)**: Significant absorption around 60 GHz
- **Water Vapor (H₂O)**: Primary absorber at microwave frequencies, peaks around 22 GHz
- **Other Gases**: Nitrogen, CO₂, and trace gases contribute minimally

**Frequency Dependence**:
- Minimal at frequencies < 10 GHz (typically < 1 dB)
- Increases rapidly above 10 GHz
- Very significant above 30 GHz

**Elevation Angle Effect**:
- Lower elevation angles mean longer atmospheric path
- Loss inversely proportional to sin(elevation angle)
- Polar orbiting satellites have variable loss due to changing elevation angles

**Typical Values**:
- **L-band** (1-2 GHz): ~0.1 dB
- **C-band** (6 GHz): ~0.2-0.3 dB
- **Ku-band** (12 GHz): ~0.5-1 dB
- **Ka-band** (30 GHz): ~2-5 dB

## 3.4. Rain Loss

**Definition**: Rain loss occurs due to absorption and scattering of radio waves by raindrops. It is highly dependent on frequency, rainfall rate, and drop size distribution.

**Frequency Dependence**:
- Negligible at frequencies < 10 GHz
- Becomes significant at Ku-band (12 GHz)
- Major concern for Ka-band (30 GHz) and above

**Rain Loss Formula** (Simplified):
$$L_{rain} \text{ (dB/km)} = k \cdot R^{\alpha}$$

Where:
- $R$ = rainfall rate (mm/hr)
- $k, \alpha$ = frequency-dependent constants

**Typical Rain Loss Values**:
- **Ku-band at 20 mm/hr rain**: ~2-5 dB
- **Ka-band at 20 mm/hr rain**: ~10-20 dB

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Diversity**: Use multiple ground stations or satellites
- **Increased EIRP**: Compensate for loss with more transmit power
- **Link Margin**: Design system with additional power margin during rain
- **Frequency Selection**: Choose lower frequencies when possible
- **Adaptive Coding**: Adjust modulation and coding based on rain conditions

**Path Length Effect**:
- Rain loss depends on the length of the propagation path through rain
- For oblique paths (non-vertical), effective rain height ≈ 2-4 km
- Can be estimated using location-specific rain statistics
