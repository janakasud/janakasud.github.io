# 1. Antenna Theory

## Isotropic Antenna

An **isotropic antenna** is a theoretical reference antenna that radiates power uniformly in all directions equally. It serves as the baseline for defining antenna gain.

**Characteristics**:
- Radiates a spherical wave with uniform power $\frac{p_o}{4\pi}$ in any direction $(\theta, \phi)$
- Where $p_o$ is the total power available at the antenna input
- Power radiated per unit solid angle is constant: $\frac{p_o}{4\pi}$ steradians

**Significance**: Real antennas are compared against this ideal to quantify their directivity.

## Directional Antenna

A **directional antenna** concentrates power in specific directions while reducing radiation in others.

**Characteristics**:
- Radiates variable power $p(\theta, \phi)$ depending on direction
- Maximum radiation in the preferred direction (main lobe)
- Reduced radiation in other directions (side lobes, back lobe)
- Total radiated power equals input power

$$p_o = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\pi} p(\theta, \phi) \sin \theta \, d\theta \, d\phi$$

**Advantage**: Concentrates transmit power in useful directions and focuses received power from desired directions.

## Antenna Gain

### Definition

The **gain** of an antenna in a specific direction is the ratio of power radiated in that direction to the power an isotropic antenna would radiate in the same direction:

$$g(\theta, \phi) = \frac{p(\theta, \phi)}{p_o / 4\pi}$$

Where:
- $p(\theta, \phi)$ = Power radiated toward direction $(\theta, \phi)$
- $p_o$ = Total radiated power
- Gain is dimensionless (linear ratio)

### Maximum Gain

The **maximum antenna gain** is the peak gain function:

$$g_{\max} = \frac{p_{\max}}{p_o / 4\pi}$$

Where $p_{\max}$ is the maximum power radiated in any direction.

### Gain in Decibels

The maximum gain is commonly expressed in **decibels over isotropic (dBi)**:

$$G \text{ (dBi)} = 10 \log_{10}(g_{\max})$$

**Examples**:
- Isotropic antenna: $G = 0$ dBi (by definition)
- Half-wave dipole: $G \approx 2.15$ dBi
- Parabolic dish (1 m, 10 GHz): $G \approx 35$ dBi
- Parabolic dish (3 m, 12 GHz): $G \approx 45$ dBi

**Note**: Gain in **dBd** (decibels over dipole) = Gain in dBi - 2.15 dB

## Antenna Effective Aperture

### Definition

The **effective aperture** (or effective area) $A_e$ is the equivalent area that represents how effectively an antenna captures incident electromagnetic power.

**Physical Interpretation**: 
- If a plane wave with power flux density $S$ (W/m²) is incident on the antenna
- Received power = $P_r = S \times A_e$
- $A_e$ is always smaller than physical antenna area due to efficiency

### Relationship Between Gain and Effective Aperture

The fundamental relationship is:

$$G = \frac{4\pi}{\lambda^2} A_e$$

Where:
- $G$ = Antenna gain (linear ratio)
- $\lambda$ = Wavelength
- $A_e$ = Effective aperture

### Derivation

**Starting from reciprocity principle**: An antenna has the same gain whether transmitting or receiving.

**For transmission**: 
$$\text{Power flux density at distance } d = \frac{\text{EIRP}}{4\pi d^2} = \frac{G \cdot P_t}{4\pi d^2}$$

**For reception** (same antenna):
$$P_r = S \times A_e = \frac{\text{EIRP}}{4\pi d^2} \times A_e$$

By reciprocity, the received power must relate to transmit power through path loss and gains:
$$P_r = P_t + G_t - L_{\text{path}} + G_r$$

Combining these and simplifying:
$$A_e = \frac{\lambda^2 G}{4\pi}$$

Therefore:
$$G = \frac{4\pi A_e}{\lambda^2}$$

### Antenna Efficiency

Real antennas have efficiency factor $\eta$ (typically 0.5-0.95):

$$A_e = \eta \times A_{\text{physical}}$$

$$G = \eta \times \frac{4\pi A_{\text{physical}}}{\lambda^2}$$

**Examples**:
- Parabolic dish: $\eta \approx 0.6-0.7$
- Horn antenna: $\eta \approx 0.8-0.9$
- Dipole: $\eta \approx 0.7-0.8$

### Practical Calculation

For a parabolic dish antenna:

$$A_{\text{physical}} = \pi \left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}$$

$$G = \eta \times \frac{4\pi}{\lambda^2} \times \frac{\pi D^2}{4} = \eta \times \frac{\pi^2 D^2}{\lambda^2}$$

**Example**: 2.4 m dish at 12 GHz (λ = 0.025 m)
$$G = 0.65 \times \frac{\pi^2 \times (2.4)^2}{(0.025)^2} \approx 58,700 \text{ (linear)} \approx 47.7 \text{ dBi}$$

## Antenna Radiation Pattern

### Main Lobe and Side Lobes

The **radiation pattern** shows how antenna gain varies with direction:

- **Main lobe**: Direction of maximum radiation
- **Side lobes**: Secondary lobes at lower gain levels
- **Back lobe**: Radiation in opposite direction to main lobe
- **Null**: Directions with zero or minimal radiation

### Beamwidth

**3-dB Beamwidth** (Half-Power Beamwidth, HPBW) is the angular width where gain is 3 dB below peak:

$$\text{HPBW} \approx \frac{1.02 \lambda}{D} \text{ radians} = \frac{58.6 \lambda}{D} \text{ degrees}$$

For a parabolic dish, narrower beamwidth means:
- Higher gain
- More directional
- More difficult to point accurately

**Trade-off**: Must balance gain requirements with pointing complexity.

## Polarization

Antenna **polarization** describes the orientation of the electric field:

- **Linear (H or V)**: Electric field oscillates in fixed direction
- **Circular (RHCP or LHCP)**: Electric field rotates in circular motion

**Importance**:
- Transmit and receive antennas should have **matching polarization** for efficient coupling
- **Polarization isolation** prevents interference between co-frequency systems
- Satellite systems often use dual-pol antennas (orthogonal channels)

---

## Antenna Noise Temperature

When an antenna receives signals, it also receives thermal noise from the environment:

**Effective Antenna Noise Temperature**:
- Clear sky: $T_{\text{sky}} \approx 50-80$ K (depending on frequency and elevation angle)
- Pointing at ground: $T_{\text{ground}} \approx 290$ K
- Pointing at sun: $T_{\text{sun}} \approx 10,000$ K

**System Noise Temperature** combines antenna temperature with receiver noise (as discussed in G/T section).

## Antenna Gain Realizable Limits

Antenna gain is fundamentally limited by laws of physics:

$$G \leq \eta \times \frac{\pi^2 D^2}{\lambda^2}$$

### Practical Limits

1. **Size vs. Frequency**: At fixed frequency, larger antennas have higher gain
2. **Frequency**: Higher frequencies enable same gain with smaller antennas
3. **Efficiency**: Cannot exceed ~95% for practical antennas
4. **Mechanical**: Very large antennas become difficult and expensive to manufacture and point

### Trade-offs in System Design

- **Small antenna + high frequency**: Compact, high gain, but requires precision
- **Large antenna + low frequency**: More robust, lower cost, but bulky
- **Practical balance**: Choose antenna size and frequency for mission requirements
