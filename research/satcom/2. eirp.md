# 2. EIRP

## Definition

**EIRP** (Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power) is the effective power radiated by an antenna, assuming it radiates equally in all directions (isotropic radiator). It represents the power that would be needed by an isotropic antenna to achieve the same signal strength at a given distance as the actual antenna does.

## Formula

$$\text{EIRP} = P_t \times G_t$$

Where:
- $P_t$ = Transmitter power output
- $G_t$ = Antenna gain (linear ratio, not in dB)

In decibels:
$$\text{EIRP (dBW)} = P_t \text{ (dBW)} + G_t \text{ (dBi)}$$

Or using watts and dB:
$$\text{EIRP (dBm)} = P_t \text{ (dBm)} + G_t \text{ (dBi)}$$

## Importance in Satellite Communications

1. **Link Budget Analysis**: EIRP is a critical parameter in calculating the link budget to determine whether a communication link is feasible
2. **Signal Strength**: Determines the power density at the receiving location on Earth
3. **Coverage Planning**: Higher EIRP allows coverage of larger areas or weaker receiver systems
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: FCC and ITU regulations often specify maximum allowable EIRP to prevent interference

## Key Considerations

- **Antenna Gain**: More directional antennas (higher gain) concentrate power in specific directions, increasing EIRP
- **Power Efficiency**: EIRP helps optimize the use of limited satellite power resources
- **Rain Attenuation**: In heavy rain, higher EIRP may be needed to maintain link margins
- **Earth Station Characteristics**: Ground stations use EIRP to effectively reach satellites in orbit

## Example

A satellite transmitter with:
- Output power: 10 W (10 dBW)
- Antenna gain: 20 dBi

$$\text{EIRP} = 10 + 20 = 30 \text{ dBW}$$

Or equivalently: $10 \text{ W} \times 100 = 1000 \text{ W}$ (1 kW effective isotropic power)
