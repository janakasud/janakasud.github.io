# 6. Carrier-to-Noise Ratio

## Definition

**Carrier-to-Noise Ratio (C/N)** is the ratio of the received carrier signal power to the received noise power in the same bandwidth. It is a fundamental measure of link quality and directly determines the achievable data rate and error performance of a communication system.

**Notation**: C/N, SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), or C/No (when noise is expressed as power spectral density)

**Units**: 
- Ratio (linear) or dB (logarithmic)
- C/No typically in dB-Hz (power spectral density ratio)

## Key Relationships

### Noise Floor

The noise power in a system is determined by:

$$N = k_B T B F$$

Where:
- $k_B$ = Boltzmann's constant ($1.38 \times 10^{-23}$ J/K)
- $T$ = System noise temperature (in Kelvin)
- $B$ = Bandwidth (in Hz)
- $F$ = Noise figure (linear ratio ≥ 1)

In decibels:
$$N \text{ (dBm)} = -174 \text{ dBm/Hz} + 10\log_{10}(B) + NF$$

Where:
- -174 dBm/Hz = thermal noise at 290 K
- $NF$ = Noise figure (in dB)

### C/N Ratio Calculation

$$C/N = \frac{P_r}{N} = \frac{P_r}{k_B T B F}$$

In decibels:
$$C/N \text{ (dB)} = P_r \text{ (dBm)} - N \text{ (dBm)}$$

Or alternatively:
$$C/N \text{ (dB)} = P_r \text{ (dBm)} + 174 \text{ dBm/Hz} - 10\log_{10}(B) - NF$$

### C/No (Noise Power Spectral Density)

A useful derived metric:
$$C/N_o = \frac{P_r}{N_o} = \frac{P_r}{k_B T F}$$

Where $N_o$ is noise power per Hz (does not include bandwidth).

In decibels:
$$C/N_o \text{ (dB-Hz)} = P_r \text{ (dBm)} + 174 \text{ dBm/Hz} - NF$$

**Advantage**: C/No is independent of bandwidth, making it useful for comparing different systems.

## Relationship to Link Budget

From the link budget equation:
$$P_r = \text{EIRP} - L_{path} + G_r$$

Therefore:
$$C/N_o = (\text{EIRP} - L_{path} + G_r) + 174 - NF$$

This shows how system design parameters (EIRP, losses, antenna gain, noise figure) directly determine achievable C/N.

## Noise Figure

**Noise Figure (NF)** quantifies how much noise the receiver adds to the system.

$$NF = \frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{input}}}{\text{SNR}_{\text{output}}}$$

**Practical Values**:
- **Excellent receiver**: 0.5 dB (noise temperature ≈ 40 K)
- **Good receiver**: 1 dB (noise temperature ≈ 75 K)
- **Typical receiver**: 2-3 dB (noise temperature ≈ 170-290 K)
- **Poor receiver**: 5+ dB

**Key Insight**: Lower noise figure means better performance; typical satellite Earth station receivers have NF = 0.5-2 dB.

### Cascade Noise Figure

For a cascaded system (amplifier → demodulator):
$$NF_{\text{total}} = NF_1 + \frac{NF_2 - 1}{G_1} + \frac{NF_3 - 1}{G_1 G_2} + ...$$

**Implication**: The first amplifier's noise figure dominates; use a low-noise amplifier (LNA) as the first stage.

## Required C/N for Different Modulations

The **required C/N** depends on the modulation scheme and desired **Bit Error Rate (BER)**.

| Modulation | BER = 10⁻⁶ | BER = 10⁻⁹ |
|---|---|---|
| **BPSK** | 10.5 dB | 12.5 dB |
| **QPSK** | 10.5 dB | 12.5 dB |
| **8-PSK** | 14.5 dB | 16.5 dB |
| **16-QAM** | 18.5 dB | 20.5 dB |
| **64-QAM** | 24.5 dB | 26.5 dB |

**Observation**:
- Higher-order modulations require higher C/N
- BER = 10⁻⁶ typical for commercial systems
- BER = 10⁻⁹ typical for critical applications
- ~2 dB C/N penalty per order of magnitude improvement in BER

## Relationship to Data Rate

By the Shannon-Hartley theorem, the maximum achievable data rate is:

$$C = B \log_2\left(1 + \frac{C}{N}\right)$$

Where:
- $C$ = Channel capacity (bits/second)
- $B$ = Bandwidth (Hz)
- $C/N$ = Carrier-to-noise ratio (linear)

**For practical systems with modulation coding**:
$$R = B \eta \log_2(M)$$

Where:
- $\eta$ = Power efficiency factor (depends on C/N and coding)
- $M$ = Modulation order

**Key Insight**: Higher C/N enables higher data rates, but with diminishing returns due to Shannon's limit.

## System Trade-offs

### Improving C/N

**Transmit Side**:
- ↑ Increase EIRP (transmit power or antenna gain)
- ↓ Reduce path loss (closer satellite or lower frequency)

**Receive Side**:
- ↑ Increase antenna gain (larger dish)
- ↓ Reduce noise figure (better LNA or cooling)
- ↓ Reduce bandwidth (if data rate allows)

**Trade-offs**:
- Larger antennas are expensive and require pointing systems
- Better LNAs are expensive
- Lower bandwidth reduces data rate

### Typical System Design Process

1. **Define requirements**: Needed data rate and BER
2. **Select modulation**: Choose modulation scheme
3. **Calculate required C/N**: From tables or Shannon's formula
4. **Account for margins**: Add 2-4 dB fade margin
5. **Design budget**: Allocate EIRP, antenna gains, noise figure to meet C/N requirement

## Practical Example: Ku-band Downlink

**System Parameters**:
- Satellite EIRP: 70 dBW
- Free space loss: -210 dB
- Atmospheric loss: -1 dB
- Receiving antenna gain: 45 dBi
- Received power: 70 - 210 - 1 + 45 = **-96 dBW**

**Receiver Parameters**:
- Noise figure: 1.5 dB
- System noise temperature: 110 K
- Bandwidth: 36 MHz

**Noise Calculation**:
$$N = -174 + 10\log_{10}(36 \times 10^6) + 1.5 = -174 + 75.6 + 1.5 = -96.9 \text{ dBm}$$

**C/N Ratio**:
$$C/N = -96 - (-96.9) = +0.9 \text{ dB}$$

**Interpretation**: This link is **barely marginal**. Required C/N for QPSK is ~10.5 dB, so this system would fail. Solutions:
- Increase satellite EIRP
- Use larger receiving antenna
- Reduce receiver noise figure
- Reduce bandwidth (if data rate allows)

## Impact of Channel Conditions

### Clear Sky
- All link budget margins available
- Highest C/N achievable
- Best performance

### Cloudy/Light Rain
- Atmospheric attenuation: ~0.5-2 dB additional loss
- C/N degradation: 0.5-2 dB

### Heavy Rain
- Rain attenuation: 3-20+ dB (frequency dependent)
- C/N degradation: 3-20+ dB
- Link may fail if margin insufficient

**Mitigation**: Design with adequate fade margin for target availability (e.g., 99.5% or 99.9%).

## C/N in Different Satellite Orbits

| Orbit Type | Distance | Typical C/N (dB) | Challenges |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GEO** | 36,000 km | 5-15 | High path loss, interference |
| **MEO** | 10,000 km | 15-25 | Variable elevation angle |
| **LEO** | 500-2000 km | 25-35 | Rapid satellite movement |

**Observation**: LEO satellites achieve better C/N due to shorter distances, enabling higher data rates despite smaller satellite power budgets.
